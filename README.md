# Home Loan Prediction System
## Overview
This project focuses on building a machine learning-based system to predict home loan approvals. Designed for JPMorgan Chase, the model analyzes customer data to determine eligibility for loans. The system uses predictive analytics to enhance the decision-making process, providing a reliable tool for bank employees.

## Objective
To develop a predictive model that accurately classifies loan applications into "approved" or "rejected" categories and deploy it on a user-friendly website for real-time use by JPMorgan Chase employees.

## Features 
Data Analysis and Visualization: Explore loan data to identify trends and insights.
Machine Learning Models: Implement and compare algorithms, including Random Forest, SVM, Gradient Boosting, and Naive Bayes.
High Accuracy: Achieved 98% accuracy using the Random Forest classifier.
Web Deployment: Interactive website for end-users to input data and receive predictions.

## Dataset
Source: [Kaggle Loan Approval Prediction Dataset](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/architsharma01/loan-approval-prediction-dataset)
Contains demographic, financial, and credit-related information about applicants.

## Technologies Used
Languages: Python
Libraries: Pandas, NumPy, Scikit-learn, Matplotlib, Seaborn
Tools: Jupyter Notebook 

## Steps
Data preprocessing: Handling missing values, encoding categorical features, scaling numerical data.
Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA): Insights into the dataset.
Model building: Random Forest, SVM, Naive Bayes, and Gradient Boosting classifiers.
Evaluation: Confusion matrix, accuracy scores, and cross-validation.
